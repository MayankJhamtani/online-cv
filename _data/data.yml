    - role: Summer Research Intern
      time: May - July, 2018
      company: Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore
      details: |
        I worked under the guidance of professor [Parimal Parag]() in the Distributed Systems
        research group at ECE Department, IISc. The work involved using Coding Theory to analyse
        latency trade-offs in distributed storage frameworks, with a particular emphasis on Fountain
        Codes.[Code](https://github.com/orgs/ResearchRep/teams/age-information-6)

    - role: Data Analytics Intern
      time: May - July, 2017
      company: Adani Power, Tirora
      details: |
        The work involved developing a prediction mechanism for electricity prices in the
        [Indian Energy Exchange](https://www.iexindia.com/#?id=7&mid=0). The complete pipeline involved scraping online data, filtering noise,
        and making the final prediction system using Convolutional Nueral nets. Various architectures were
        tested on multiple metrics. [Code]() [Report]()
